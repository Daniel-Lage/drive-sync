# meme-updater
uploads and downloads memes from your google drive

program that checks folders from your machine and google drive, uploads files that are present in your machine and not in the drive and downloading those that are in the drive and not your machine.

i decided to apply this to memes (because i have nothing else to store tbh) but it works on any tipe of file and any folder you want to synchronize.

requires setup in google cloud in order to be able to use pydrive.
